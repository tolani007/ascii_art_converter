# Video_to_ASCII_art_converter
This project implements a Video-to-ASCII Art Converter, transforming video frames into ASCII art using Python and OpenCV. It allows users to convert any video file into a sequence of ASCII characters, creating a unique and artistic representation of the video.


Features:
Frame-by-frame conversion: Each frame from the video is resized, converted to grayscale, and then mapped to an ASCII character grid.

Customization: The width of the output ASCII video and the ASCII characters used for the conversion can be customized.

Output: The ASCII art for each frame is saved to a video file, which can be viewed in any video player once downloaded.
