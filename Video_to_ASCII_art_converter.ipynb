        "The `cv2.VideoWriter` continues to fail even with alternative codecs, which suggests a more fundamental issue with either the OpenCV installation's ability to write videos in this environment or a permissions issue with the output directory. Since I cannot directly address environment or permissions issues as an AI, and `imageio` has successfully read frames, I will focus on generating the ASCII art images and save them as a sequence of image files instead of attempting to write a video. This allows the core processing pipeline (reading frames, grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, resizing, and ASCII art generation) to be completed and the output to be examined, even if a video file cannot be created. I will then update the summary to reflect the inability to create a video output and the successful generation of image frames.\n",
